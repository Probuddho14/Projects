# Information and Instructions
This is a To-Do List web app made using HTML, CSS, javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Popper.js.
It is a feature packed interactive To-Do List web-app.

This is an intership project that I made under 1stop.ai in collaboration with Indian Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar.

Before trying to run the HTML code, please:
i) Create a single folder in your local machine.
ii) In that folder, keep the HTML file, and all the other folders that you can find in the 2nd branch of the repository named "resources".
    Copy those folders to the single folder that was created earlier.
iii) Run the HTML file.
